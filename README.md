# MUSCLE
MUltiscale Spherical ColLapse Evolution code. It also performs Zel'dovich, 2lpt, alpt.

To run MUSCLE, you need to install numpy and scipy alogside pyfftw. 

The cosmological module cosmo.py generates the linear power spectrum. In MUSCLE one can choose between a spectrum generated with Eisentein and Hu formulae or with a CLASS implementation, albeit it is a bit slower.

See the quickstart.ipynb notebook for an example.
